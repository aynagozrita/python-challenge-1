# Menu order

Description

Overall point of the project is to create a program which takes in labeled inputs taken from the dictionary called Menu.

In order to ensure that the customers are fully provided the customer is asked for their input which interates through a while loop which encompases the full program. This ensures that the customer will be able to order multiple items from the menu rather than having to start the program over again creating a more polished and seamless experince.

The main body of the program goes through all of the formating and process of adding menu items to a customers order list. This part of the program assigns values to menu items so the customer can select them at a faster pace along with this, as stated before, combines all of the ooptions into an easy to read format. This process culminates in the last part of the program which diusplays everything the customer ordered

The ending portion of the program goes encompases formating the results of the selected items into a format very similar to the one used in selecting said items. After this is accomplished the total price is added up and displayed for the customer to see.

Summary Overall this program accomplishes the task of taking in orders from customers and outputing a well crafted reciept of everything the cusitomer bought including the overall price.

Challenges 
The biggest challange for me was the loop identtion along with correctly accessing listing. However, I think project has brought a new undestanding of dictionary and loops.
